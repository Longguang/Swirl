  |====================                                                                     |  22%

| Which of the following is *not* a permitted variable name in R?

1: some-variable
2: some.variable
3: some_variable
4: someVariable

Selection: 2

| Not quite right, but keep trying.

| Variable names in R can contain uppercase or lowercase letters, digits (except at the start of
| the variable), periods, or underscores

1: someVariable
2: some_variable
3: some-variable
4: some.variable

Selection: 3

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |==============================                                                           |  33%

| Create a variable called mynum with the value 200.

> mynum <- 200

| Keep up the great work!

  |========================================                                                 |  44%

| Create a character variable called mychar that contains the words "hello world"

> mychar <- 'hello world'

| You are doing so well!

  |=================================================                                        |  56%

| Add 20 to your "mynum" variable and save it to a new variable, "mynum2"

> mynum2 <- 20 + mynum

| Almost! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Use the assignment operator, "=", and on the right hand side put the expression you want to
| calculate

> mynum2
[1] 220

| You almost had it, but not quite. Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Use the assignment operator, "=", and on the right hand side put the expression you want to
| calculate

> mynum2 = 20 + mynum

| That's not the answer I was looking for, but try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Use the assignment operator, "=", and on the right hand side put the expression you want to
| calculate

> info()

| When you are at the R prompt (>):
| -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...
| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
| -- Typing info() displays these options again.

> skip()

| Entering the following correct answer for you...

> mynum2 = mynum + 20

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |===========================================================                              |  67%

| Use R to calculate 300 divided by 90 (you do not have to save it to a variable)

> (300/90)
[1] 3.333333

| Give it another try. Or, type info() for more options.

| Use "/" for division

> 300/90
[1] 3.333333

| Nice work!

  |=====================================================================                    |  78%

| Use R to calculate 8 to the power of 4 (you do not have to save it to a variable)

> skip()

| Entering the following correct answer for you...

> 8^4

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |===============================================================================          |  89%

| Use the "log" function to compute the natural logarithm of 15

> log(15)
[1] 2.70805

| You are really on a roll!

  |=========================================================================================| 100%

| The function "cos" computes the trigonometric cosine of a number. Use this function to compute
| the cosine of 15.
