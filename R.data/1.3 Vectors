  |=========================                                                                |  29%

| Create a vector called "v1" containing four values, in this order- 2, 9, 3, 4.5.

> v1 <- c(2,9,3,4,5)

| Not quite right, but keep trying. Or, type info() for more options.

| Use the "c" function to construct a vector, and make sure you assign it to "v1"

> v1
[1] 2 9 3 4 5

| That's not the answer I was looking for, but try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Use the "c" function to construct a vector, and make sure you assign it to "v1"

> skip()

| Entering the following correct answer for you...

> v1 = c(2, 9, 3, 4.5)

| That's correct!

  |======================================                                                   |  43%

| Find the length of v1

> length(v1)
[1] 4

| Nice work!

  |===================================================                                      |  57%

| Create a vector called "v2" containing four values, in this order- 15, 4, 8, 10

> v2 <- c(15, 4, 8,10)

| You are doing so well!

  |================================================================                         |  71%

| Combine the v1 and v2 vectors into one vector of length 8, assigning the result to v3

> v3 <- c(v1, v2)

| All that practice is paying off!

  |============================================================================             |  86%

| Find the mean of v3

> mean(v3)
[1] 6.9375

| Excellent work!

  |=========================================================================================| 100%

| Extract the third value from v3

> v3$3
Error: unexpected numeric constant in "v3$3"
> v3[3]
[1] 3

| Excellent work!
