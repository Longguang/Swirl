| Welcome to Lesson 2! In this lesson, we will learn what DISPERSION is and what statistical values are needed in order to best
| describe the spread of data. Further, you will learn all about a box-and-whisker plot which is a plot commonly used by
| statisticians when determining variability.

...

  |====                                                                                                                   |   3%

| While measures of central tendency are used to estimate the middle values of a dataset, measures of dispersion are important
| for describing the spread of the data.

...

  |========                                                                                                               |   6%

| The term dispersion refers to degree to which the data values are scattered around an average value. Dispersion is synonymous
| with other words such as variability and spread.

...

  |============                                                                                                           |  10%

| Why is it important to analyze the spread of a particular set of data? Two different samples may have the same mean or median,
| but different levels of variability or vice versa.

...

  |===============                                                                                                        |  13%

| Therefore, it is important to describe both the __________ and _________ of a data set.

1: median, variability
2: central tendency, dispersion
3: middle, mean
4: spread, variability

Selection: 1

| That's not the answer I was looking for, but try again.

| The first term refers to the middle of a dataset. The second term refers to the spread of a dataset.

1: median, variability
2: central tendency, dispersion
3: middle, mean

  |===================                                                                                                    |  16%

| In this lesson, we will discuss the three statistical values most commonly used to describe the dispersion or variability of a
| data set. Variability is a fancy term used to classify how variable or spread out the data is.

...

  |=======================                                                                                                |  19%

| The first descriptive statistic that can describe the variability of a data set is known as the RANGE. The range is the
| difference between the maximum and minimum values of the data set.

...

  |===========================                                                                                            |  23%

| To demonstrate how you can use R to determine the range of a data set we will refer back to the cars data set from the
| previous lesson.

...

  |===============================                                                                                        |  26%

| Type in the R-command 'range(cars$price)' to determine the exact values for the minimum and maximum prices of cars in the data
| set.

> range(cars$price)
[1]  7.4 61.9

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |===================================                                                                                    |  29%

| Now that you have the minimum and maximum 'price' values, calculate the range of the 'price' data.

> 61.9 - 7.4
[1] 54.5

| All that practice is paying off!

  |======================================                                                                                 |  32%

| The second important measure of variability is known as VARIANCE. Mathematically, VARIANCE is the average of the squared
| differences from the mean. More simply, variance represents the total distance of the data from the mean.

...

  |==========================================                                                                             |  35%

| In R, you can use the command 'var(data)' to easily calculate the variance of a particular set of data. Try calculating the
| variance for the data 'cars$price'.

> var(cars$price)
[1] 132.3984

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |==============================================                                                                         |  39%

| The values for variance and standard deviation are very closely related. The standard deviation can be calculated by taking
| the square root of the variance where as the variance can be calculated by squaring the standard deviation.

...

  |==================================================                                                                     |  42%

| To statisticians, the standard deviation is a more conventional measure of variability because it is expressed in the same
| units as the original data values.

...

  |======================================================                                                                 |  45%

| Similar to variance, you can use the R-command 'sd(data)' to calculate the standard deviation of a particular set of data. Try
| calculating the standard deviation for the data 'cars$price'.

> sd(cars$price)
[1] 11.50645

| Great job!

  |==========================================================                                                             |  48%

| The standard deviation is very important when analyzing our data set. A small standard deviation indicates that the data
| points tend to be located near the mean value, while a large standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread
| further from the mean.

...

  |=============================================================                                                          |  52%

| A BOX PLOT, also called a BOX-AND-WHISKER PLOT, is used to summarize the main descriptive statistics of a particular data set
| and this type of plot helps illustrate the concept of variability. A box plot is used to visually represent the MINIMUM, FIRST
| QUARTILE (Q1), MEDIAN, THIRD QUARTILE (Q3), and MAXIMUM of a data set.

...

  |=========================================================================                                              |  61%

| Would you like to watch a brief YouTube video on box-and-whisker plots?

  |=============================================================================                                          |  65%

| Here I have created a box plot to represent the price data for each of the three car types: large, midsize, and small. You'll
| notice that each of the 3 figures is composed of a closed 4-sided "box" with "whiskers" on the top and bottom, hence the name
| box-and-whisker plot.

...

  |=================================================================================                                      |  68%

| The height of each box is referred to as the INTERQUARTILE RANGE (IQR). The more variability within the data, the larger the
| IQR. On the other hand, less variability within the data means a smaller IQR. The bottom of the box in the box plot
| corresponds to the value of the first quartile (Q1), and the top of the box corresponds to the value of the third quartile
| (Q3). To calculate the value of the IQR, simply subtract the value of Q1 from that of Q3.

...

  |====================================================================================                                   |  71%

| The whiskers, or lines, that extend above and below each box represent roughly the upper 25% and lower 25% of data points,
| respectively. The only exception is when there are outliers, which I'll explain shortly.

...

  |========================================================================================                               |  74%

| Looking at the box plot, what is the approximate interquartile range for the midsize vehicles?

> 20
[1] 20

| You are doing so well!

  |============================================================================================                           |  77%

| Let's take a closer look at how quartiles are calculated. We start by sorting the data from least to greatest, just like when
| calculating the median. The first quartile (Q1), also known as the 25th PERCENTILE (since 25% of the data points fall at or
| below this value), is simply the median of the first half of the sorted data. Likewise, the third quartile (Q3), also known as
| the 75th percentile, is the median of the second half of the sorted data.

...

  |================================================================================================                       |  81%

| As shown in this plot, the blue horizontal line illustrates how to find the value for the first quartile. The green horizontal
| line illustrates how to find the value for the third quartile. The interquartile range is the range of data values that is
| contained in between these two lines.

...

  |====================================================================================================                   |  84%

| Look again at our box plot of price vs. car type. You may be thinking to yourself, 'What is that circle above the box plots
| for the midsize cars, and why is there no circle above the box plot for the large cars?' Those circles represent OUTLIERS in
| the data set.

...

  |========================================================================================================               |  87%

| An OUTLIER is an observation that is unusual or extreme relative to the other values in the data set. Outliers are useful in
| identifying a heavy skew in a distribution, and may signify a data collection or data entry error to a scientist. There are
| many different conventions for identifying outliers within a data set.

...

  |===========================================================================================================            |  90%

| When looking at the box plot, which car types appear to have outliers?

1: small, midsize, large
2: small, midsize

  |===============================================================================================================        |  94%

| As you can see in the box plot, the data for prices of 'midsize' cars vary from around 15 to 62, encompassing a range of
| approximately 50. This is a great deal larger than the variation for 'small' cars which range from around 5 to 15,
| encompassing a range of approximately 10. Therefore, since the range is much greater for 'midsize' cars, prices of 'midsize'
| cars have much higher variability in comparison to the prices of 'small' cars.

...

  |===================================================================================================================    |  97%

| Now it is your turn! Is the variability of prices of cars of type 'large' higher or lower than that of cars of type 'small'?

1: higher
2: the same
