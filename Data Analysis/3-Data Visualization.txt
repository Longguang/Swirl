| Now that you have learned the basics techniques and statistical calculations used to describe a data set, the next step is
| figuring out how to effectively illustrate and visualize your data.

...

  |====                                                                                                                   |   3%

| It is useful to first visualize the data before a statistician engages in a thorough analysis of the data set. In this lesson,
| we are going to learn useful techniques for visualizing numerical variables.

...

  |========                                                                                                               |   7%

| By organizing the data into a PLOT or GRAPH, a statistician is able to explore and summarize some basic properties of the data
| set. The discipline of quantitatively describing the main properties of a data set is known as DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS.

...

  |============                                                                                                           |  10%

| The simplest type of plot is the DOT PLOT, which is used to visually convey the values of one variable. In a dot plot, there
| is only a horizontal x-axis, and the data points are represented as dots above this axis.

...

  |================                                                                                                       |  13%

| Here is a dot plot created using the variable 'price' from our 'cars' data set. As you may notice, the price is reported along
| the x-axis in $1000s, and each point above the axis represents the price of one of the 54 cars in our data set.

...

  |====================                                                                                                   |  17%

| When looking at this dot plot, around what price (in $1000s) does there appear to be the highest density of data points?

> 10
[1] 10

| Keep up the great work!

  |========================                                                                                               |  20%

| Since dot plots effectively display the specific numerical value of one variable for each individual in the data set, they are
| particularly useful when analyzing smaller data sets.

...

  |============================                                                                                           |  23%

| A HISTOGRAM is similar to a dot plot, but instead of showing every specific value, it partitions the values of your data into
| several bins, providing a more condensed representation of the data.

...

  |================================                                                                                       |  27%

| Here I have created a histogram using the miles per gallon data for all of our cars. As you may notice, the values of the MPG
| along the x-axis are partitioned into bins with a range of 5. The second bin, for example, groups together all of the cars
| that get 21-25 MPG in the city, and so forth. Note that the bin to the left of this contains those cars with 20 MPG since this
| value cannot be counted in both bins. The frequency of values in each bin, or the number of cars in each of the intervals, is
| reported along the y-axis.

...

  |====================================                                                                                   |  30%

| Taller bars signify the range of values in which the majority of the data is located, whereas shorter bars represent a range
| of values in which only a little bit of the data is located. In other words, histograms provide a view of the DATA DENSITY.

...

  |========================================                                                                               |  33%

| By simply looking at this histogram, can you tell me which MPG interval has the highest frequency of values? For example, the
| lowest frequencies of values occur in the intervals 36-40, 41-45, and 46-50.

1: 36-40
2: 16-20
3: 21-25
4: 26-30
5: 41-45
6: 46-50
7: 31-35

| You are quite good my friend!

  |============================================                                                                           |  37%

| How many cars get 16-20 MPG in the city?

> 25
[1] 25

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |================================================                                                                       |  40%

| A red line has been drawn on our histogram illustrating the previous answer.

...

  |====================================================                                                                   |  43%

| Histograms are particularly useful in viewing and describing the shape of the distribution of the data. A distribution of data
| may have a left skew, a right skew, or no skew at all. SKEWNESS is a measure of the extent to which the distribution of the
| data 'leans' to one side or the other.

...

  |========================================================                                                               |  47%

| A distribution that has a left skew is one in which the left TAIL of the plot is longer. In other words, on a histogram the
| majority of the distribution is located to the right of the mean.

...

  |============================================================                                                           |  50%

| When a distribution is left-skewed, the value of the MEAN is less than that of the MEDIAN, and thus the MEAN is located
| further to the left of the distribution. In this plot, the green line represents the median and the blue line represents the
| mean.

...

  |===============================================================                                                        |  53%

| On the other hand, a distribution that has a right skew is one in which the right tail is longer, such that the majority of
| the data falls to the left of the mean, when viewed on the histogram.

...

  |===================================================================                                                    |  57%

| When a distribution is right-skewed, the value of the MEAN is greater than that of the MEDIAN, and thus the MEAN is located
| further to the right of the distribution. In this plot, the green line represents the median and the blue line represents the
| mean.

...

  |=======================================================================                                                |  60%

| A plot that has no skew is one in which the tails on both sides of the mean balance out, and is referred to as symmetric. When
| a distribution is symmetric, the MEAN and MEDIAN are approximately equal in value.

...

  |===========================================================================                                            |  63%

| In this plot, the green line represents the median and the blue line represents the mean. The green line is the only one
| visible since the mean and median are close to the same value.

...

  |===============================================================================                                        |  67%

| Now, let's take a look back at the histogram we made earlier, which represents the distribution of the values for city MPG for
| each of the 54 cars from our 'cars' data set.

...

  |===================================================================================                                    |  70%

| How would you classify the shape of the distribution represented by this histogram?

1: Symmetric
2: Left-skewed
3: Right-skewed

Selection: 3

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |=======================================================================================                                |  73%

| Referring to the histogram above, and keeping in mind the real shape of the distribution, would you expect the MEDIAN to be
| greater than, less than, or equal to the MEAN?

1: Less than
2: Equal to
3: Greater than

Selection: 1

| That's the answer I was looking for.

| A special type of histogram is known as a STEM-AND-LEAF PLOT. This plot organizes numerical data in order of decimal place
| value. The left-hand column of the plot contains the STEMS, or the numerical values of the tens digit for each of the data
| points, organized vertically in increasing order. The LEAVES are located in the right-hand column of the plot and are the
| values of the ones digit for each data point of the corresponding stem, organized horizontally in increasing order.

...

  |===============================================================================================                        |  80%

| In a stem-and-leaf plot, the number of leaves is equal to the number of items in the data set. The easiest way to understand a
| stem-and-leaf plot is to see one!

...

  |===================================================================================================                    |  83%

| Would you like to watch a brief YouTube video on stem-and-leaf plots?

| I have created a stem-and-leaf plot above using the same values for the 'mpgCity' variable as we just used for our histogram.
| As you can see, a stem-and-leaf plot is a useful type of histogram if you want to see the frequencies of specific values of
| the data. Often, there will only be one bin per tens digit, but in this case, R gives us the same bins as we saw in our
| histogram.



  The decimal point is 1 digit(s) to the right of the |

  1 | 66677788888899999999
  2 | 0000011112222333
  2 | 55588999999
  3 | 1123
  3 | 9

...

  |===========================================================================================================            |  90%

| Demonstrated on this stem-and-leaf plot, how many occurences of the value '22' are there in this particular data set?

| The final plot that can be used for discrete or continuous variables is known as the BOX PLOT, also called a BOX-AND-WHISKER
| PLOT. As you previously learned, this plot is used to summarize the main descriptive statistics of a particular data set and
| help illustrates the concept of variability. I have created a box-and-whisker plot so that you can be reminded of what it
| looks like.

...

  |===================================================================================================================    |  97%

| A box plot is used to visually represent the MINIMUM, FIRST QUARTILE (Q1), MEDIAN, THIRD QUARTILE (Q3), and MAXIMUM of a data
| set. The R-command 'summary(cars$price)' returns values for these main descriptive statistics. Try this now.

> summary(cars$price)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
   7.40   10.95   17.25   19.99   26.25   61.90 

| That's a job well done!

| Up until now, every plot I have introduced has involved only one continous or discrete variable. In a future lesson, we will
| learn about the plots that are used for categorical variables and multiple variables.
