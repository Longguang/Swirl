| Today, I'll be teaching you the basics of data analysis. It probably makes sense to start by defining the word DATA.

...

  |====                                                                                                                   |   3%

| According to Wikipedia, "Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items."

...

  |========                                                                                                               |   7%

| Often the "set of items" that we are interested in studying is referred to as the POPULATION. Data analysis usually involves
| studying a subset, or SAMPLE, of an entire population.

...

  |============                                                                                                           |  10%

| Here is a diagram showing the relationship between a population and a sample.

...

  |================                                                                                                       |  14%

| Data analysis should always start with a specific question of interest. For example, we might ask "What percentage of people
| living in the United States are over six feet tall?"

...

  |=====================                                                                                                  |  17%

| Here, our population of interest is everyone living in the US. Since it's impractical to measure the heights of over 300
| million people, we could instead choose 100 people at random and measure their heights. Our hope would be that this sample of
| 100 people is REPRESENTATIVE of the entire US population.

...

  |=========================                                                                                              |  21%

| Let's quickly test your understanding of the term REPRESENTATIVE. If you were interested in studying the health of men living
| in the US, ages 18-25, which sample would be more representative of the target population: a sample of 50 men who live in a
| nearby retirement home, or a sample of 50 men who are students at a local university?

1: Men living at the retirement home
2: College students

Selection: 1

| Nice try, but that's not exactly what I was hoping for. Try again.

| Since your target population is all men ages 18-25 living in the US, which of these 2 sample populations
| more closely matches the population of interest?

1: College students
2: Men living at the retirement home

Selection: 1

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |=================================                                                                                      |  28%

| The purpose of analyzing a sample is to draw conclusions about the population from which the sample was
| selected. This is called INFERENCE and is the primary goal of INFERENTIAL STATISTICS.

...

  |=====================================                                                                                  |  31%

| In order to make any inferences about the population, we first need to describe the sample. This is the
| primary goal of DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS.

...

  |=========================================                                                                              |  34%

| If we want to describe our sample using just one number, how would we best do it? A good start is to find
| the center, the middle, or the most common element of our data. Statisticians call this the CENTRAL
| TENDENCY.

...

  |=============================================                                                                          |  38%

| There are three different methods for finding such a number and the applicability of each method depends
| on the situation. Those three methods are called the MEAN, MEDIAN, and MODE.

...

  |=================================================                                                                      |  41%

| You'll notice the rows are numbered 1 through 54, each representing exactly one car in the dataset. For
| each car, the following VARIABLES, or characteristics, are reported: 'type' (small, midsize, large),
| 'price' (USD), 'mpgCity' (city miles per gallon), 'driveTrain' (4WD, front, rear), 'passengers' (total
| capacity), and 'weight' (lbs).

...

  |======================================================================                                                 |  59%

| We'll be focusing on the 'mpgCity' variable in this lesson. For simplicity, let's extract it from our
| dataset and store it in a new variable.

...

  |==========================================================================                                             |  62%

| Access the 'mpgCity' variable from the 'cars' dataset using the 'dataset$variable' notation.

| Now store the contents of the 'cars$mpgCity' in a new variable called 'myMPG'.

> cars[, "myMPG"] <- cars$mpgCity

| That's not the expression I expected but it works.

| cars[, "myMPG"] <- cars$mpgCity is not identical to myMPG <- cars$mpgCity. Differences: target, current
| do not match when deparsed

| Excellent job!

  |==================================================================================                                     |  69%

| The ARITHMETIC MEAN, or simply the MEAN or AVERAGE, is the most common measurement of central tendency.
| To calculate the mean of a dataset, you first sum all of the values and then divide that sum by the total
| number of values in the dataset.

...

  |======================================================================================                                 |  72%

| However, when there are many values of interest, it becomes tedious to do this calculation by hand.
| Luckily, R has a built-in function for computing the mean. The syntax for doing so is 'mean(variable)'.

...

  |==========================================================================================                             |  76%

| Compute the mean value for the 'myMPG' variable now.

| All that practice is paying off!

  |==============================================================================================                         |  79%

| Extreme values in our dataset can have a significant influence on the mean. For instance, if there was a
| car in our dataset that got 200 miles per gallon, this would inflate the mean upwards. This could be
| misleading since none of the other cars get anywhere near this gas mileage.

...

  |==================================================================================================                     |  83%

| An alternative to the mean, which is not influenced at all by extreme values, is the MEDIAN. The median
| is computed by sorting all values from least to greatest and then selecting the middle value. If there is
| an even number of values, then there are actually 2 middle values. In this case, the MEDIAN is equal to
| the MEAN of the 2 middle values. Don't worry if this is a little confusing. It will become more clear
| with practice.

...

  |=======================================================================================================                |  86%

| R also has a function for computing the median of a dataset and this is done by typing
| 'median(variable)'. Find the median value of your 'myMPG' variable now.

> median(myMPG)

| You got it!

  |===========================================================================================================            |  90%

| Finally, we may be most interested in finding the value that shows up the most in our dataset. In other
| words, what is the most common value in our dataset? This is called the MODE and it is found by counting
| the number of times that each value appears in the dataset and selecting the most frequent value.

...

  |===============================================================================================================        |  93%

| Use the 'table' function to see how many times each value appears for your 'myMPG' variable. The syntax
| for this function is the same as for the others you've seen.

> table(myMPG)
myMPG
16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 25 28 29 31 32 33 39 42 46 
 3  3  6  8  5  4  4  3  3  2  6  2  1  1  1  1  1 

| That's correct!

  |===================================================================================================================    |  97%

| Look at your table for the 'myMPG' variable that you created above. The first row gives you the value of
| your variable and the second row gives you the number of times it appears in your dataset. Since the mode
| is the value of our variable that appears most frequently, what is the mode of your 'myMPG' variable?
