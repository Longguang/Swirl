| In this lesson, we'll review basic ideas of probability, the study of quantifying the
| likelihood of particular events occurring. Note the similarity between the words probability
| and probably. Every time you use the latter word you're implying that an event is more likely
| than not to occur.

| The first step in understanding probability is to see if you understand what outcomes of an
| experiment are possible. For instance, if you were rolling a single, fair die once, how many
| outcomes are possible?

| The probability of a particular outcome of an experiment is the ratio of the number of ways
| that outcome can occur to all possible outcomes of the experiment. Since there are 6 possible
| outcomes to the experiment of rolling a die, and we assume the die is fair, each outcome is
| equally likely. So what is the probability of rolling a 2?

| Since the probability of a particular outcome or event E is the ratio of ways that E could
| occur to the number of all possible outcomes or events, the probability of E, denoted P(E), is
| always between 0 and 1. Impossible events have a probability of 0 (since they can't occur) and
| events that are certain to occur have a probability of 1.

...

  |===================                                                                     |  21%

| If you're doing an experiment with n possible outcomes, say e1, e2, ..., en, then the sum of
| the probabilities of all the outcomes is 1. If all the outcomes are equally likely, as in the
| case of a fair die, then the probability of each is 1/n.

...

  |======================                                                                  |  25%

| If A and B are two independent events then the probability of them both occurring is the
| product of the probabilities. P(A&B) = P(A) * P(B)

| Since we don't care what the outcome of the first roll is, its probability is 1. The second

| The probability of at least one of two events, A and B, occurring is the sum of their
| individual probabilities minus the probability of their intersection. P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) -
| P(A&B).

... 

  |===============================================                                         |  54%

| It's easy to see why this is. Calculating P(A) and P(B) counts outcomes that are in both A and
| B twice, so they're overcounted. The probability of the intersection of the two events, denoted
| as A&B, must be subtracted from the sum.
