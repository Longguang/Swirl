| In this lesson, we'll briefly introduce basics of statistical inference, the process of
| drawing conclusions "about a population using noisy statistical data where uncertainty must
| be accounted for". In other words, statistical inference lets scientists formulate
| conclusions from data and quantify the uncertainty arising from using incomplete data.

  |===================                                                                 |  22%

| Which of the following is NOT an example of statistical inference?

1: Constructing a medical image from fMRI data
2: Recording the results of a statistics exam
3: Polling before an election to predict its outcome
4: Testing the efficacy of a new drug

Selection: 2

| That's correct!

  |============================                                                        |  33%

| So statistical inference involves formulating conclusions using data AND quantifying the
| uncertainty associated with those conclusions. The uncertainty could arise from incomplete
| or bad data.

  |=====================================                                               |  44%

| Which of the following would NOT be a source of bad data?

1: Selection bias
2: A poorly designed study
3: Small sample size
4: A randomly selected sample of population

Selection: 1

| That's not exactly what I'm looking for. Try again.

| Which of the choices would allow one to draw reasonable inferences?

1: A poorly designed study
2: Selection bias
3: Small sample size
4: A randomly selected sample of population

Selection: 4

| Keep up the great work!

  |===============================================                                     |  56%

| So with statistical inference we use data to draw general conclusions about a population.
| Which of the following would a scientist using statistical inference techniques consider a
| problem?

1: Our data sample is representative of the population
2: Contaminated data
3: Our study has no bias and is well-designed

Selection: 2

| You are quite good my friend!

  |========================================================                            |  67%

| Which of the following is NOT an example of statistical inference in action?

1: Counting sheep
2: Testing the effectiveness of a medical treatment
3: Estimating the proportion of people who will vote for a candidate
4: Determining a causative mechanism underlying a disease

Selection: 4

| Not exactly. Give it another go.

| Which of the choices is exact?

1: Counting sheep
2: Estimating the proportion of people who will vote for a candidate
3: Testing the effectiveness of a medical treatment
4: Determining a causative mechanism underlying a disease

Selection: 1

| You got it right!

| We want to emphasize a couple of important points here. First, a statistic (singular) is a
| number computed from a sample of data. We use statistics to infer information about a
| population. Second, a random variable is an outcome from an experiment. Deterministic
| processes, such as computing means or variances, applied to random variables, produce
| additional random variables which have their own distributions. It's important to keep
| straight which distributions you're talking about.

...

  |===========================================================================         |  89%

| Finally, there are two broad flavors of inference. The first is frequency, which uses "long
| run proportion of times an event occurs in independent, identically distributed
| repetitions." The second is Bayesian in which the probability estimate for a hypothesis is
| updated as additional evidence is acquired. Both flavors require an understanding of
| probability so that's what the next lessons will cover.
